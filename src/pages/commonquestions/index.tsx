          Visual Identity is a set of elements that visually express the essence
          of a company, person, service, or event. Comprising colors,
          typography, and specific shapes, it centers around the logo as its
          central element, serving as the foundation for all related materials.

          <p>
            Similar to an individual, a company needs its own identity that sets
            it apart and makes it unique. This not only instills confidence in
            the customer but also aids in memorability and identification across
            various brand touchpoints such as business cards, bags, packaging,
            letterheads, envelopes, among others. Below, we highlight eight
            reasons why investing in design is crucial for the success of your
            company:

          <ul className="flex list-disc flex-col gap-6 pl-8">
            <li>
              <strong>Adds Value:</strong> Brands with interesting design stand
              out from the competition, allowing for pricing with higher profit
              margins.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Increases Visibility:</strong> Brands without design or
              with inappropriate design risk being overlooked, necessitating
              additional investments in marketing and advertising.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Facilitates Purchase:</strong> Good design acts as a
              facilitator, assisting the consumer in the purchasing decision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Optimizes Usability:</strong> Effective design
              significantly reduces the learning curve, making interaction more
              intuitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Builds Identity:</strong> Like individuals, brands need a
              solid identity. Design contributes to the distinctiveness and
              personality construction of the brand.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retains the Target Audience:</strong> Attractive design
              creates identification, encouraging customer loyalty to your
              brand.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Credibility:</strong> Trust is fundamental, and
              well-crafted visual communication is the first step in building
              that trust.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Facilitates Communication:</strong> Well-designed visual
              identity effectively directs the conversation with the audience,
              making the implementation of strategies easier and more efficient.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Investing in Visual Identity is not just an option but an essential
            strategy to stand out in the market, build lasting relationships
            with customers, and strengthen your brand presence.

        <div>What is The Distinction between Logo and Visual Identity?</div>
      ),
      text: (
        <div className="overflow-hidden">
          While the logo is simply a graphic element that symbolizes your
          company, the Visual Identity design is notably more comprehensive. It
          goes beyond the logo, incorporating a variety of elements that give
          personality to the brand, such as colors, typography, icons, textures,
          patterns, and various other possibilities. Visual Identity is not
          limited to the graphic aspect alone; it embraces the brand&apos;s
          touchpoints and its entire visual universe. Additionally, it takes
          into account the current context of the company and its future goals,
          considering variables and scopes to ensure a coherent and evolving
          representation of the brand&apos;s identity.

          information. Next, I present a proposal that includes detailed costs
          and timelines, automatically transforming into a contract to ensure
          both parties. Upon accepting the terms, simply sign and return the
          contract, with a 50% upfront payment of the total project cost serving

          requires a 50% upfront payment, with the remaining amount due upon
          project presentation. If you prefer to explore installment options via
