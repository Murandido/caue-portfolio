                <strong>What is Visual Identity?</strong>
                <p>
                  Visual Identity is a set of elements that visually express the
                  essence of a company, person, service, or event. Comprising
                  colors, typography, and specific shapes, it centers around the
                  logo as its central element, serving as the foundation for all
                  related materials.

                <strong>Why Invest in Visual Identity?</strong>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Similar to an individual, a company needs its own identity
                    that sets it apart and makes it unique. This not only
                    instills confidence in the customer but also aids in
                    memorability and identification across various brand
                    touchpoints such as business cards, bags, packaging,
                    letterheads, envelopes, among others. Below, we highlight
                    eight reasons why investing in design is crucial for the
                    success of your company:

                  What is The Distinction between Logo and Visual Identity?
                </strong>
                <p>
                  While the logo is simply a graphic element that symbolizes
                  your company, the Visual Identity design is notably more
                  comprehensive. It goes beyond the logo, incorporating a
                  variety of elements that give personality to the brand, such
                  as colors, typography, icons, textures, patterns, and various
                  other possibilities. Visual Identity is not limited to the
                  graphic aspect alone; it embraces the brand&apos;s touchpoints
                  and its entire visual universe. Additionally, it takes into
                  account the current context of the company and its future
                  goals, considering variables and scopes to ensure a coherent
                  and evolving representation of the brand&apos;s identity.

                <strong>How Does the Service Hiring Process Unfold?</strong>
                <p>
                  The process to hire the service begins with the initial
                  contact, where you share details about your business.
                  Following a feasibility analysis, we schedule a meeting to
                  delve into the necessary information. Next, I present a
                  proposal that includes detailed costs and timelines,
                  automatically transforming into a contract to ensure both
                  parties. Upon accepting the terms, simply sign and return the
                  contract, with a 50% upfront payment of the total project cost
                  serving as a signal to reserve the agreed-upon date.

                <p>
                  To facilitate the payment process, we offer the convenience of
                  bank transfer, Pix, or boleto (bank slip). The standard
                  payment method requires a 50% upfront payment, with the
                  remaining amount due upon project presentation. If you prefer
                  to explore installment options via credit card, specific
                  details can be discussed to meet your needs.

                  After the 50% down payment is made, we will consider the
                  agreement closed, and the date specified in the contract will

                  This process is in place to ensure careful and dedicated
